        <h2>Investing Basics</h2>
        <p>The key is to buy low and sell high! Try to buy stocks that, based on trends displayed in graphs, you expect
          will go up in price after you buy them.
          You also want to develop a diverse portfolio. This means that you should aim to have investments that are in
          unrelated business areas, as well as a good mix of investment types
          (stocks/bonds). Finally, here at Prudential, we want our investments to be sustainable, meaning they have
          Environmental, Social, and/or Governance benefits, forming the acronym
          ESG. To learn more about ESG Integration and the different categories, navigate over to the ESG Integration
          tab.

      <div id="Tab3" class="tab-content" [ngClass]="{'active': activeTab === 'Tab3'}">
        <h2>ESG Integration</h2>
        <p>ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. Environmental refers to mitigating climate change and
          harm
          to the environment, Social refers to ensuring financial security for all and taking care of employees, and
          Governance refers to always driving company actions
          with Prudential's core values. Whenever possible, ESG factors should be considered when determining where to
          invest our money and how to analyze security, since ESG factors can heavily affect asset returns in the long
          run.
          Though return on investment is important, Prudential separates itself from the rest by also considering ESG
          factors to be vital.
